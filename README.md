introduce maven intellij project

There are two main ways to set up Maven in IntelliJ IDEA:

Creating a new project with a Maven archetype:

This is the recommended approach for new projects.
Open the New Project wizard.
Select Build System Maven
Configure your project details like name, location, and optionally a Git repository.
IntelliJ IDEA will automatically set up Maven for the project, including creating a pom.xml file.

Adding Maven support to an existing project:

This is useful if you have an existing Java project that you want to convert to a Maven project.
Open the existing project in IntelliJ IDEA.
Right-click on the project directory or module in the Project tool window.
Select Add Framework Support.
Choose Maven from the options and click OK.
IntelliJ IDEA will add a pom.xml file and configure the project structure for Maven.
